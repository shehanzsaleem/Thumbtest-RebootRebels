These cats are known for their drunken sailor walk, which is why they're known endearingly as wobbly cats. Unless a CH cat has other health issues, their life expectancy is the same as a cat without CH. Since the condition is non-progressive, it will never get worse; and in some cases, owners say that their cats become more capable over time. Ever since Ralphee was brought home, Max is never far away. He appears to be forever curious and watches over Ralphee wherever she goes. Despite her condition, Ralphee is a happy cat who, like most kittens loves affection and causing all sorts of trouble wherever she goes. Source: WAKALEO ANIMAL CHANNEL.

I had long-<i>ish</i> hair at one point: slightly past my shoulders. I could make a basic ponytail, but it was nothing to write home about. Braids weren&#39;t thick and pretty; they were flimsy and resembled a rat tail as they lay on my neck. Updos were &quot;meh.&quot; My hair was almost always down, either stick straight or in waves.</p>\n<p>Once I graduated college, I realized that my hair stopped growing completely, possibly from my birth control. I took vitamins, every hair-growth pill on the market, and even changed my diet for healthy hair to no avail. My hair was shiny and strong. But long? Nope.</p>\n<p>When I started at POPSUGAR, I decided to use clip-in extensions. It&#39;s interesting, because extensions are a bit taboo. Some feel women are &quot;conforming to society&quot; if we want long hair. Or, on the flip side, we (women) don&#39;t want to admit that we want long hair but can&#39;t achieve it on our own - that we had a little help. I&#39;m all about embracing your God-given beauty, but hey, if you want long hair, what&#39;s the big deal? Extensions make all the difference. In fact, Enzo Angeleri, the man behind <a class=sugar_inline_link title=Latest photos and news for Charlize Theron href=http://www.popsugar.com/Charlize-Theron target=_blank>Charlize Theron</a> and a bevy of other Hollywood A-listers, applied a few to my hair for this tutorial and insisted I keep them for fullness. Extensions are the norm on red carpets and photo shoots. They can add instant length or make your hair full and voluminous - or both.</p>\n<p>I became addicted. I wasn&#39;t just wearing them for shoots, I was wearing them every day! I loved my long hair. I could create works of art that I was never able to achieve B.E. (That&#39;s &quot;before extensions.&quot;) But at the end of the day, they would be removed with just a clip. </p>\n<p>Here&#39;s the thing: I didn&#39;t mind taking them out. It was nice to have versatility with my hair: shorter, Courtney Love waves one day; long, mermaid strands the next. But to keep the clip-ins in place and to help hide them, backcombing (or &quot;teasing&quot; to some) the hair is crucial. It did some damage to my roots and, ultimately, affected the integrity of my hair. So I stopped wearing them altogether.</p>\n<p>Then I ventured to the mecca of hair extensions here in Los Angeles, Nine Zero One salon. Nikki Lee and Riawna Capri built this salon five years ago, bringing on a bevy of expert stylists and colorists, and have made themselves a reputation for serving A-List clientele. Some of the stars who have extensions, cuts, and color from the salon? Oh, <a class=sugar_inline_link title=Latest photos and news for Selena Gomez href=http://www.popsugar.com/Selena-Gomez target=_blank>Selena Gomez</a>, <a class=sugar_inline_link title=Latest photos and news for Vanessa Hudgens href=http://www.popsugar.com/Vanessa-Hudgens target=_blank>Vanessa Hudgens</a>, Julianne Hough, Emma Roberts, and even Steven Tyler, to name a few.</p>\n<p>In a matter of an hour and a half, two extensions specialists, my girl Nicole Leal, and her partner, Shaylee Blatz, applied keratin-tipped bundles of hair to my natural hair. Sixteen inches, to be precise. Once applied, they cut and styled my new locks, and off I went, with hair I couldn&#39;t grow myself, that will last three to five months. <i>All in less than two hours.</i></p>\n<p>I have to admit that it wasn&#39;t just a &quot;pop in and book an appointment&quot; experience. I had been color matched for my extensions a few weeks prior - crucial to the process - then went in and had them applied. The color matching is essential, given you shouldn&#39;t color your extensions and, chances are, you&#39;ll want them to match your natural hair color. </p>\n<p><b>A few things about Great Lengths hair extensions:</b></p>\n\nI love them.\nYou can&#39;t wash your hair for 48 hours after application.\nOnce you do wash your hair, focus shampoo directly on the scalp, and conditioner at the ends of the hair. Applying conditioners directly to the bonds can loosen them up and make them slip through your hair.\nThey&#39;re very secure, though. But when you brush your hair, be gentle.\nBrush your hair twice daily to avoid tangles; sleep in a loose ponytail with a ribbon tie.\nSleep on a silk pillowcase if possible.\nDon&#39;t apply heat directly to the bonds. If you curl or straighten your hair, apply the heat a few inches away from the bond.\n\n<p><b>Update 2/3/15:</b> I&#39;ve had my Great Lengths extensions for about four months now - a little longer than recommended - and I absolutely love them. So much so, that I&#39;m going to get them again! Over the past few months, only about 6-8 extensions have come out, which is normal. As my hair grew, they felt even more natural, and flowed beautifully onto my shoulders. I&#39;ve gotten my hair cut and colored and have had plenty of blowouts with these babies, and they held up quite nicely. One thing I always get told from my stylists is that I take good care of them: they aren&#39;t tangled, dreading or look like a mess. I attribute this to brushing through my hair a few times a day and also making sure to pick apart the extensions at the root so they don&#39;t get tangled within one another.</p>\n<p>For this segment, I received more hair than I probably would have normally gotten (for transformation purposes), but I&#39;m glad I went extra long for my first go-around. And I can&#39;t wait to get my new &quot;hair lingerie&quot; in a few days! I&#39;ll let you guys know how my hair looks once I get them out.</p>", "video_url": "http://shine.yahoo.com/video/hair-extensions-improved-self-confidence-190513127.html", "title": "Hair Extensions: Not So Taboo", "thumbnail_url": "http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/video/video.sugar.com/70d515ceef75f5e341f54f18fc342ff4", "duration": 136, "uuid": "6f3a1fa1-44e8-3263-9bdc-0afff5f0cb98"}, {"category": "Comedy", "thumbnail_frame_index": 155, "description": "The workplace faces many different stereotypes.

A jazz singer herself, she bases the names of all her polishes around songs.

And she was happy to oblige. Instead of keeping things understated like she typically does for Fashion Week, it was all about length and bling with this manicure. Deborah has worked on the nails of everyone from Lupita Nyong&#39;o to <a class=sugar_inline_link title=Latest photos and news for Lady Gaga href=http://www.popsugar.com/Lady-Gaga target=_blank>Lady Gaga</a>, and she most recently worked on rapper Iggy Azalea. &quot;I loved her,&quot; beamed Deborah. &quot;She was really funny.&quot; </p>\n<p>Vowing to satiate my inner Rihanna, Deb decided to apply long claws to my natural nails, but not before giving them a paint job in Rolling in the Deep, a deep navy blue. Then, she added a glitter tip in Stronger and applied a clear coat of polish so the Swarovski crystals would stick. (Yes, Swarovski crystals.) To finish things off, she coated the back of the nail with the crystals and adhered the nail to my natural nail.</p>\n<p>My nails were practically weapons, but you could easily tone down the look for everyday wear. Just paint everything on your natural nail and adorn them with a few faux crystals to create that &quot;blinged-out&quot; moment. </p>", "video_url": "http://shine.yahoo.com/video/deborah-lippmann-stops-grammys-manicure-190000870.html", "title": "Deborah Lippmann Stops by For Some Grammys Manicure Inspiration", "thumbnail_url": "http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/video/video.sugar.com/09f004f9c618722cb9a430174ab5fc9b", "duration": 144, "uuid": "d91b27d2-aebb-3558-aec8-bb732399e037"}, {"category": "Gaming", "thumbnail_frame_index": 732, "description": "Ea Sports Ufc", "video_url": "https://www.yahoo.com/movies/video/ea-sports-ufc-173700098.html", "title": "Ea Sports Ufc", "thumbnail_url": "http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/video/video.internetvideoarchive.com/b0fcfab4d6509b10ea50bf2cef43a583", "duration": 90, "uuid": "d9725b4b-1183-371a-92dd-61ce0bbcce3f"}, {"category": "Celebrity", "thumbnail_frame_index": 4070, "description": "Danny Trejo is back as the long-haired hero of Robert Rodriguez's exploitation action film, but just how much do you know about Machete?", "video_url": "https://www.yahoo.com/celebrity/video/10-mind-blowing-machete-facts-164005267.html", "title": "10 Mind-blowing Machete Facts", "thumbnail_url": "http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/video/video.alist.com/91a0b7ddd71f45271f55deaaf0f62628", "duration": 179, "uuid": "d9c7d1aa-9e0f-36c6-91cf-7d7738e582f3"}, {"category": "Cute & Inspiring", "thumbnail_frame_index": 1031, "description": "While thinking of how he could help his friend Carlos, who is deaf and blind, experience the excitement of the World Cup, Brazilian sign language interpreter Helio Fonseca de Araujo came up with this brilliant idea.

And Lil Bub is one of its biggest stars \u00e2\u0080\u0094 an odd-looking yet totally adorable perma-kitten, famous for her big, green eyes, long pink tongue, and rumbling purr. Help Lil Bub's Big Fund by visiting <a class= target= href=http://lilbub.com/bigfund>LIl Bub's Big Fund</a><br>\n\n<br>\n\nIn honor of Pet Week, we are featuring a playlist of animal videos \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and Lil Bub leads the pack.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n    The furry feline is more than a memorable mug: The runt of a litter born in an Indiana toolshed in 2011, Lil Bub was rescued by Mike Bridavsky, who took her in after others declined to do so.\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n    Even at eight weeks, it was clear the little kitty had some serious afflictions and would require a great deal of care.\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n    Bub was born with multiple genetic mutations that add up to her one-of-a-kind look: Dwarfism gives her stubby legs and a long body, making movement difficult. She has an extra toe on each paw. Her teeth never grew in and her short lower jaw leaves her tongue hanging out.\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n    Then there are those big, green eyes \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and the noises she makes. Her sounds are absolutely bizarre, Bridavsky said. She doesn't sound like a cat.\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n    The recording engineer already shares his house with four other cats, and didn't want another \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but Lil Bub proved irresistible. I saw a picture and fell in love, Bridavsky told Yahoo Screen. I like things that are unique and special. And Bub is the epitome of all that.\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n    After he posted photos of Lil Bub on his Tumblr blog, many others (including Oscar winner Whoopi Goldberg) fell for her as\nwell. The rest is Internet history: The feline fame resulted in a documentary, a book, a Web series, and a TV show. It's all to help a good cause: <a class= target= href=http://lilbub.com/bigfund>LIl Bub's Big Fund</a>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n    In fact, everything Lil Bub does is to raise money and awareness for cats with special needs \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Bridavsky calls her the poster child.\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n    The video of Lil Bub at the park shows her running around and healthy, but it wasn't always that way. About a year ago she could barely move, said Bridavsky. It's kind of a miracle.\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n    Next up, Lil Bub will be greeting up to 200 paying fans at the #Oaklandcatvidfest on May 10 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 all to benefit charity.\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n    We got interested in Lil Bub, because she was rescued by Mike, festival producer Issabella Shields told Yahoo Screen. She's just magical. Her little purr, her little squeak. She just radiates sweetness. You just don't get bored of watching her.\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\nHer fans would agree.\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Claudine Zap (@zapkidd)", "video_url": "http://news.yahoo.com/video/lil-bub-goes-park-195645346.html", "title": "Sweet Story Of Famously Cute 'Lil Bub' And Owner (read below)", "thumbnail_url": "http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/video/video.pd2upload.com/video.discoverychannel2.com@ddabd865-9888-352f-91bf-6a0235af7b73_FULL.jpg", "duration": 74, "uuid": "ddabd865-9888-352f-91bf-6a0235af7b73"}, {"category": "Food", "thumbnail_frame_index": 416, "description": "Preheat oven to 450F.
